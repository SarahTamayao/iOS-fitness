## Overview
### Description
A fitness app that allows the user to plan a daily routine, with videos available on the internet. It also allows the user to save videos from multiple platforms on this app from apps such as 
    Instagram, Youtube, TikTok etc. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle/ Fitness 
- **Mobile:** iOS App
- **Story:** User can save videos to be referenced later, and be able to plan a routine with free 
                videos available online. 
- **Market:** Influencers, users looking to organize their workout videos 
- **Habit:** This app could be used everyday or as often as the users exercise habits are. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with the user being able to search and save the videos available  
                this app. Then, the user could organize specific videos to a playlist. Then, a 
                scrolling timeline. If we had time, the ability to share with other people and 
                integrated with the user's calendar.

## Overview
### Description
Tracks what music an individual listens to, and pairs them with others based on that music. Could be potentially used as a dating app, or just meeting new friends with similar music tastes.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
